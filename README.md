## Explanation of SSD MobileNet

SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector) is a deep learning model used for object detection. SSD models detect objects in images by splitting the image into a grid and predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities for each grid cell. SSD is designed to perform detection in a single pass, making it fast and efficient.

MobileNet is a lightweight neural network designed for resource-constrained environments, such as mobile and embedded devices. Combined with SSD, MobileNet is effective for fast, real-time object detection with minimal computational resources.

SSD MobileNet V3 is an optimized version of the SSD MobileNet model, trained on the COCO dataset, which contains 80 different object classes.
